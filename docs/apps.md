## Why Winfig Apps?

While Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a popular way to turn web services into desktop-like experiences, they rely on your browser as a backend. This means they often consume significant RAM and CPU, especially when running multiple apps or tabs.

**Winfig Apps** use [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), which leverages a lightweight system webview instead of a full browser engine. This approach offers:

- **Lower resource usage:** Minimal RAM and CPU consumption compared to browser-based PWAs.
- **Better performance:** Faster startup and smoother operation.
- **Native integration:** Apps feel and behave more like true desktop applications.
- **Improved security:** Smaller attack surface and less exposure to browser vulnerabilities.

With Winfig Apps, you get the convenience of web services with the efficiency and feel of native desktop software.
