## Overview

**Get-Winfig** is an open-source initiative focused on building a modular, transparent, and fully customizable Windows configuration and deployment ecosystem.

At its core, Winfig automates every stage of the Windows setup process from system installation and configuration to post installation optimization. It transforms hours of repetitive manual setup into a structured, reproducible, and verifiable workflow.

This project is not a single script or tool, but an ecosystem of modular repositories each dedicated to a specific aspect of Windows configuration. Whether it’s **system deployment**, **debloating**, **security hardening**, **forensic workstation preparation**, or **workspace automation**, every component is designed for efficiency, consistency, and reliability.

## Why I Started This Project

As a **Digital Forensics** and **Cybersecurity** student, I repeatedly found myself rebuilding and reconfiguring Windows environments installing tools, applying policies, disabling telemetry, and hardening systems for investigation or analysis.

Over time, this became an exhausting cycle. I realized there had to be a better way.

> “Why not build a transparent, community-driven framework that anyone can use, extend, and improve?”

> “Why not empower users to take complete control of their Windows experience, free from bloatware and unnecessary complexity?”

**Get-Winfig** was created from these questions. It bridges **system administration**, **automation**, and **cybersecurity** into a unified and maintainable framework.

## The Meaning Behind “Winfig”

The name “Winfig” is derived from **Windows Configuration**.

The prefix **Get-** pays homage to PowerShell syntax, symbolizing both a command and a philosophy:

- [x] Retrieve.
- [x] Automate.
- [x] Standardize.

Together, **Get-Winfig** reflects a balance of simplicity, transparency, and control.

## Core Principles

| Principle           | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| **Modularity**      | Each function or configuration exists as a reusable module or repository. |
| **Transparency**    | 100% open-source PowerShell, XML, and batch logic—no hidden binaries or dependencies. |
| **Reproducibility** | Achieve consistent, secure environments across systems, VMs, and organizations. |
| **Security**        | Every configuration follows modern cybersecurity and privacy best practices. |
| **Education**       | Designed to teach Windows internals and automation while enabling real-world use. |

## Who It’s For

- [x] **Students and Researchers** – Easily rebuild test or lab systems.
- [x] **Forensic Analysts** – Deploy controlled, trusted analysis environments.
- [x] **System Builders and IT Professionals** – Ensure reproducible and auditable installations.
- [x] **Security Enthusiasts** – Maintain control and visibility over every system process.
- [x] **Developers** – Automate Windows environment setup for testing or CI/CD workflows.
- [x] **Power Users** – Optimize and declutter Windows systems while maintaining functionality.

## The Bigger Picture

Winfig is more than a configuration tool it’s a platform for learning, experimentation, and control.
Each module is designed with clarity and documentation in mind, so anyone can see what’s happening under the hood.

Whether you want to:

- [x] Automate forensic workstation setups,
- [x] Customize your Windows image with **unattend.xml**,
- [x] Remove preinstalled applications,
- [x] Apply enterprise grade hardening policies
- [x] Build a fully automated and reproducible deployment pipeline

**Winfig** gives you the framework to make it possible.
