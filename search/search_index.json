It transforms hours of repetitive manual setup into a structured, reproducible, and verifiable workflow.</p> <p>This project is not a single script or tool, but an ecosystem of modular repositories each dedicated to a specific aspect of Windows configuration. Whether it\u2019s system deployment, debloating, security hardening, forensic workstation preparation, or workspace automation, every component is designed for efficiency, consistency, and reliability.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#why-i-started-this-project","title":"Why I Started This Project","text":"<p>As a Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity student, I repeatedly found myself rebuilding and reconfiguring Windows environments installing tools, applying policies, disabling telemetry, and hardening systems for investigation or analysis.</p> <p>Over time, this became an exhausting cycle.
